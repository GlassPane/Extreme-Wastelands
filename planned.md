# Roadmap

## World Generation

- [ ] Wastelands World Type
- [ ] no grass, dirt, trees or plants
- [ ] salvage iron from scrap metal piles, sometimes you find broken electronics which can be processed into gold

### Biomes
- [ ] dirty river
- [ ] dirty ocean
- [ ] wasteland (rocky area, not much height variation)
- [ ] dry swamp (flat, dirt surface, patches of scrap metal)
- [ ] desert
- [ ] red desert
- [ ] stone desert (rocks and boulders laying around, ravines in the bottom, much height variation)
- [ ] mesa biomes (very tall mountains)
- [ ] dry rivers (inbetween mesa mountains)
- [ ] dry forest (dead trees, stumps, fallen trees, no leaves or shrooms)

### Structures
- [ ] ruins of single houses
- [ ] ruins of cities
- [ ] forts (villages surrounded by wooden or metal palisades, replaces vanilla villages)
- [ ] broken vault-type structures

<br/>

## Blocks
- [ ] scrap metal (can be mined for metal parts)
- [ ] barbed wire (for blocking off mobs / other players)
- [ ] metal fence
- [ ] scrap iron walls
- [ ] scrap iron gate (big door)
- [ ] scrap iron gate (motorized)
- [ ] palisade blocks
- [ ] palisade gate (just a big door)
- [ ] caltrops
- [ ] spike plates (can be attached to walls as well)
- [ ] irradiated dirt (can be processed into regular dirt)
- [ ] irradiated water (highly toxic, can be processed into regular water)
- [ ] dead log (trees will have no leaves)
- [ ] radioactive acid (fluid, can be used as a cheap energy source and in lamps, buckets are furnace fuel)
- [ ] lead ore --> lead
- [ ] aluminum ore --> aluminum
- [ ] lonsdaleite --> can be found rarely, will drop small chunks of lonsdaleite
- [ ] uranium (can be used as reactor fuel or for nukes)
- [ ] metal pile (yields: steel nuggets, iron nuggets, electronics parts)
- [ ] organic pile (yields: contaminated organic matter)

<br/>

<br/>

## Items
- [ ] bolt cutter (to remove barbed wire without being hurt by it
- [ ] syringe (empty)
- [ ] potion syringes (insta-use potions)
- [ ] hazard suit (to not be harmed by toxic/acidic weather)
- [ ] lead ingot (traits: provides radiation shielding; heavy; toxic)
- [ ] aluminum ingot (traits: lightweight; not much shielding, dust can be used for decontamination of resources)
- [ ] lonsdaleite (traits: no radiation protectio, very durable, better protection than diamond)
- [ ] steel ingot (highly durable crafting material, for advanced building)
- [ ] nuggets/dusts for all the ingots
- [ ] electronics parts (can be used for crafting, or can be reprocessed to obtain gold nuggets)
- [ ] contaminated organic matter (can be decontaminated into all kinds of plants, flowers, vines, seeds, grass seeds, etc...)
- [ ] grass seeds (grow a block of dirt into a grass block, transform cobble or stone bricks into their mossy variants on right click, takes some time to grow)
- [ ] portable crafter (crafting table that doesn't need to be placed)

## Mechanics

### Crafting
- [ ] spiked armor (regular armor + leather + spikes = thorns enchantment on armor)

### Machines
- [ ] Decontaminator (consumes aluminum dust to clean irradiated materials)
- [ ] nuclear battery (single-use battery, cannot be charged)
- [ ] battery (rechargeable battery)
- [ ] charger (charges batteries)
- [ ] nuclear reactor (mid-tier power generator; produces toxic waste)

### Weather
- [ ] occasional storms, sometimes of toxic, sometimes of acid nature
- [ ] acid storms constantly damage the player if not wearing a helmet, and damage helmets rapidly
- [ ] toxic storms apply a constant poison and hunger effect to the player if not wearing a helmet
- [ ] view is obstructed during storms
- [ ] sandstorms in desert type biomes

### Radiation
- [ ] limits maximum health, but does not directly kill you; health can only regenerate to the limit set by radiation amount (at maximum goes down to 2 hearts)
- [ ] at maximum strength, radiation potion effect
- [ ] entire surface is contaminated, do not go outside without proper radiation shielding
- [ ] no radiation effects on first 2 days after joining the world (player-based, not world based)
